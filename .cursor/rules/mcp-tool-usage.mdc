## Think MCP (PRIMARY THINKING TOOL)
- Use for ALL analysis tasks, debugging, troubleshooting, complex problem-solving, and project planning
- Structure thoughts in a logical progression:
  - Begin with problem definition and context assessment
  - Analyze alternatives and trade-offs
  - Conclude with concrete action plans
- Record all reasoning processes to maintain decision history
- Use for multi-step problem decomposition
- Recall previous thoughts when needed for context

## Sequential Thinking MCP (SECONDARY TOOL)
- Only use when explicitly requested by user
- Do not use if Think MCP has already been applied to the same problem
- Ensure there's no collision between Think and Sequential Thinking tools

## Web Search Tools
- Use Brave Search for general programming questions, error messages, documentation
- Use Tavily Search for specialized technical content, library-specific information
- Focus queries on specific technical terms and include version information
- Report found information with sources
- Combine with Think MCP to refine solutions based on research
