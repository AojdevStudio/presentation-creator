# Overview
The Automated Slide Creation System (ASCS) is a powerful tool that leverages OpenAI's Assistants API to automate the end-to-end process of creating professional presentations. This system eliminates the need for manual PowerPoint or Google Slides interaction, saving valuable time and effort for professionals who frequently create presentations. The solution is designed for business professionals, data analysts, and anyone who needs to create data-driven presentations efficiently.

# Core Features

1. Automated Content Generation
   - What: AI-powered content generation for slides based on user input and data
   - Why: Reduces time spent on content creation and ensures consistency
   - How: Utilizes GPT-4 through Assistants API to generate relevant content and structure

2. Data Visualization Integration
   - What: Automatic creation of charts and graphs from data sources
   - Why: Transforms raw data into meaningful visualizations without manual effort
   - How: Combines code interpreter capabilities with python-pptx for chart generation

3. Template Management
   - What: Smart template system for consistent slide formatting
   - Why: Maintains brand consistency and professional appearance
   - How: Pre-defined python-pptx templates with customizable styles

4. Multi-format Support
   - What: Support for various input formats (text, CSV, JSON) and output as PPTX
   - Why: Flexibility in data sources and compatibility with standard presentation software
   - How: File conversion utilities and python-pptx export capabilities
